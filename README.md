# Trajectories-In-The-Universe
This is project made by our group (Group No.:07) using Numerical Methods

We uplods various python file which give trajectories of celestial bodies in the universe.
You can change mass of object, velocity of object in these codes to produce new results.
Put appropriate number of points and time period to getting better results.
